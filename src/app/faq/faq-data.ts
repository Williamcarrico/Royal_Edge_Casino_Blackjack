        question: 'What are the basic rules of blackjack?',
        answer: 'The objective of blackjack is to beat the dealer by having a hand value closer to 21 without exceeding it.

        question: 'What is a "soft hand" vs a "hard hand"?',
        answer: 'A "soft hand" contains an Ace being counted as 11 without busting (going over 21). A "hard hand" either has no Ace, or has an Ace that must be counted as 1 to avoid busting. This distinction is important for strategy decisions, as soft hands allow you to hit without risk of busting.',
